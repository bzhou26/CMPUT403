/* UVa problem: 10327
 *
 * Topic: Sorting
 *
 * Level: 1 point
 *
 * Brief problem description:
 *
 *   Sorting in computer science is an important part. Almost every
 *   problem can be solved effeciently if sorted data are found. There
 *   are some excellent sorting algorithm which has already acheived
 *   the lower bound n Â· lg n. In this problem we will also discuss
 *   about a new sorting approach. In this approach only one operation
 *   (Flip) is available and that is you can exchange two adjacent terms.
 *   If you think a while, you will see that it is always possible to sort
 *   a set of numbers in this way.
 *
 * Solution Summary:
 *
 *   use bubble sort
 *
 * Used Resources:
 *
 *
 *
 * I hereby certify that I have produced the following solution myself
 * using the resources listed above in accordance with the CMPUT 403
 * collaboration policy.
