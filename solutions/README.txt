Fill out problems_done.txt correctly.

Place your source code for each solved problem in the appropriate folder
(e.g. a 2-point problem from UVa goes into UVa_2). Ensure each file
has the proper comment header. We should be able to submit your file
exactly as is and have it accepted. Do NOT include source code unless
it is accepted by the appropriate judge system.

Each folder should simply contain the different source code files for the
various problems you solved. Do not submit compiled executables, sample
input/output files, etc. No subdirectories. Up to a 2% deduction may be
applied for each milestone if your most recent astep submission is not
correctly organized this way.

Name the source code files the following way:

uva_<number>.[language extension]
kattis_id.[language extension]

uva_100.cpp
uva_200.java

kattis_cardgame.cpp
kattis_bridges.py

Bundle everything into a single tarfile and submit via:

astep -c c403 -p problems solutions.tgz

Submit regularly as you solve problems! Your most recent submission before
each milestone will be the one that is checked for that milestone.
